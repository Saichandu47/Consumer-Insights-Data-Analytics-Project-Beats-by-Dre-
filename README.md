# Consumer-Insights-Data-Analytics-Project-Beats-by-Dre-
In this project, I developed proficiency in Python and various data science libraries to perform comprehensive sentiment analysis on consumer reviews. I applied exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover underlying patterns and trends within large datasets, ultimately providing actionable insights. Advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools, such as Gemini AI, were utilized to interpret and summarize customer feedback. Proficiency in data visualization tools enabled the presentation of these insights to inform strategic brand-building decisions.
